MovieLens Move Recommendation Capstone Project for Harvard Data Science

In this project, the goal was to give data insights on the MovieLens public dataset & to improve the performance (RMSE) of a movie recommendation algorithm by a certain amount. I have used several techniques to show the gradual improvement in each model's prediction accuracy, starting with a “Baseline” model and working my way up to techniques like “Data Regularization” & “Matrix Factorization”. To be completely honest, this is not my favorite subject as it’s very complicated, but I have included it because it’s something that I have studied & spent considerable time researching.
